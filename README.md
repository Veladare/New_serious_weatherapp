## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a scheduler app that save data and dynamically changes according to the time of day. 

In completing this project, I learned how to use dayjs to create to format the current time of day, and it improved my undertstand of how 'this' work in javascript. In addition I learn some techniques to compress my code. I discovered toggleclass to cut down on the number of line and how to create a for loop for retreiving storage in lines 21-22.
