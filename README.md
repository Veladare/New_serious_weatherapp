## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a weather application that uses an API to track the current conditions of a given city, which includes the temperature, wind speed, humidity, as well as providing the time. 

In completing this project, I reinforced my understand of js now by converting epoch to current time. I learn how to use and deploy an API to give up-to-date weather conditions. I improved my understand of how to save items in localstorage and display it in the past searches tab, and I learn how to pull particular API entries to make the 5 day forcast work.
## Installation

## Usage

To use, type in the name of a city and press search. The webpage will update and give the current weather conditions as well as the 5 day forecast. If users want to search for another city the can repeat the process stated above. If users wish to retrieve weather conditions for a city they already search for, they can select the city in the previous searches tab. 

To inspect the work from the webpage, open it and right click on it. A window will open, then click inspect and a new tab will open which shows the structure of the webpage for individuals to review. Alternatively, the webpage can be inspect via Visual Studio code or similiar programs for review.
